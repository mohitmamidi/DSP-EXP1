NumPy (short for "Numerical Python") is a fundamental library in Python used for numerical computing. It provides support for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a wide variety of mathematical functions to perform operations on these arrays efficiently.

**key features of numpy:**

**Arrays:** The core of NumPy is its powerful N-dimensional array object, ndarray.

**Mathematical Functions:** NumPy includes a variety of mathematical functions like trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic operations.

**Broadcasting:** It allows you to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes.

**Linear Algebra:** NumPy provides tools for working with linear algebra, including matrix multiplication, decompositions, and solving linear systems.

**Integration with Other Libraries:** Many scientific and machine learning libraries like SciPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow are built on top of NumPy arrays.
